# Audio Analysis and Rhythm Prediction: A Beginner's Approach
## Technical Report
### By: Harshvardhan Rathore
### Date: December 20, 2024

## 1. Introduction

For this project, I created a system that can listen to music in real-time and predict its rhythm patterns. Think of it like a smart metronome that can understand the beat of any song you play. This was my first experience working with audio processing and machine learning, and I learned a lot along the way.

## 2. Libraries and Technology Stack Used
###Programming Language

Python 3.12

###Core Libraries

librosa: Main library for music and audio analysis
numpy: For numerical computations and array operations
scikit-learn: For machine learning (Random Forest model)
sounddevice: For real-time audio input handling

###Development Tools

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as the IDE
pytest for testing
virtual environment (venv) for package management

###Helper Libraries

matplotlib: For visualizations (if needed)
queue: For handling real-time audio buffers

## 3. My Approach to Analyzing Music

I broke down the music analysis into three main parts:

1. **Understanding the Beat**
   - The system listens for when notes start playing (like drum hits or piano keys)
   - It measures how loud the music is at different moments
   - This helps figure out where the beats are happening

2. **Looking at Sound Patterns**
   - I used tools to analyze different aspects of the sound
   - This is like looking at music through different lenses to understand its rhythm better
   - The system tracks both loud and quiet parts to understand the pattern

3. **Real-time Processing**
   - The system processes small chunks of music at a time (like reading a book sentence by sentence)
   - This lets it make predictions quickly without falling behind the music

## 4. Challenges I Faced and How I Solved Them

### Challenge 1: Speed vs Accuracy
- **Problem**: The system needed to be fast enough to keep up with the music but still accurate
- **Solution**: I made it process small pieces of music at a time instead of waiting for long sections

### Challenge 2: Choosing What to Measure
- **Problem**: There are many ways to analyze music, and I had to pick the most useful ones
- **Solution**: I focused on five main measurements that work well for finding rhythm:
  1. When notes start
  2. How fast the music is
  3. Overall sound patterns
  4. How loud the music is
  5. Changes in the sound over time

### Challenge 3: Making Good Predictions
- **Problem**: Turning music measurements into accurate rhythm predictions
- **Solution**: I used a type of machine learning called Random Forest, which is like having many simple predictors work together to make a better prediction

## 5. The Prediction Model

I chose to use a Random Forest model because:
- It's good at learning patterns from examples
- It's fairly simple to understand and use
- It can make predictions quickly enough for real-time use
- It works well even with limited training data, which was perfect for my beginner project

## 6. What I Learned and Future Improvements

Through this project, I learned:
- How to process audio in Python
- Basics of machine learning with real-world data
- How to handle real-time data processing

Things I'd like to improve:
- Make it work better with different types of music
- Add the ability to follow tempo changes
- Make the predictions more accurate

## 7. Conclusion

This project was my first step into audio processing and machine learning. While there's room for improvement, I successfully created a working system that can:
1. Listen to music in real-time
2. Extract important information about the rhythm
3. Make predictions about the beat patterns

The code is modular and well-documented, making it easy to improve in the future. I'm excited to continue learning and developing these skills further.
